# Image Classification of 5 Classes using LR, NN, ResNets, Inception, and Custom ResNets
This repository explores image classification for 5 diverse classes: fence, projectile, reel, pill bottle, and snail. It compares the performance of Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, ResNets-34, Inception, and a custom ResNet model.

Key Findings:

Sharpened images and image augmentation (rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, flipping) were applied to address class imbalance (500 images per class).
Custom ResNet outperformed ResNets-34, Inception, Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression, achieving competitive accuracy and sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/F1 scores per class.
Confusion matrix visualization is included.
